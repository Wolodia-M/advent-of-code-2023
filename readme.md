# This is my solutions for [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) done in c++
Tasks are numbered in linear order (eg. day1-task1 will be 1, and day3-task2 will be 6)
### Second task on days 12 and 14 are incomplete!!!! 
To build all of this you need to install [cbuild](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cbuild/).  
Alternatively, compile_commands.json is provided.
